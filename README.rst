===========
KollaClient
===========

The following steps can be used to build / run the kollaclient:

* virtualenv .venv
* . .venv/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* python setup.py install
* kollaclient

At that point you will be dropped into the kollaclient shell where
you can run commands like help or ? to see what commands are
available and any of the sub commands can be executed directly.

Alternately you can not use the shell and just execute commands
directly via >kollaclient host add, etc.
